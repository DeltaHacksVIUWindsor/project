# DeltaHacks: UWindsor Team Project Submission
## Project Idea
Social Media for Positive Change

## Description
  When we about how we can affect positive change we think about what problems can we fix in the world. We believe one of the biggest problems that separate us from each other is the lack of communication due to not listening to each others perspective.

  We feel that as developers we can create positive change by creating a social media app that is based around difficult discussions. We want to create an environment that will curate RELEVANT NEWS about issues and events that matter and allow forums for thought out and empathetic conversations.

  In addition we want to allow our users to be able to create their own positive change about issues that matter to them and raise awareness to help bring people together to help each other.
